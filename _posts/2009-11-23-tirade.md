title: TIRADE (The IronRuby Autocad Development Environment)
---


Here is a sneak-peek at *TIRADE(The IronRuby Autocad Development Environment)* ![tirage_thumb](/images/tirade.jpg)

TIRADE extends my work on [acadhelper](http://github.com/davidbl/acadhelper) and allows instant (or at least very rapid) gratification and enjoyment of Ruby goodness when extending AutoCAD with IronRuby.

TIRADE runs modelessly, integrates RSpec and Test::Unit testing directly (slowly, but directly), has syntax highlighting and will soon have (hopeably) code completion for the acadhelper wrappers and methods.

I used the [ICSharpCode TextEditor control](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/) (with some local modifications) as the editor control and used the open source [DockPanel](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite) Suite that very closely matches the Visual Studio docking that we all know and love.

After a bit more testing, I hope to release TIRADE on the world.  Stay tuned
