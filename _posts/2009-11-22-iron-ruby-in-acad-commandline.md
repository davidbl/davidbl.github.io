title: Ruby on the AutoCAD command line
---

Using IronRuby, a bit of C# code and a great deal of aid from this [post](http://blog.tomasm.net/2009/04/15/python-says-hello-to-ruby/), I was able to create an interactive Ruby interpreter for the AutoCAD command line.

This part of my effort to bring some Ruby love to AutoCAD. The main part of my efforts can be found on [github](http://github.com/davidbl/acadhelper_loader).

The code for the REPL is available there, so I won't post it here.
